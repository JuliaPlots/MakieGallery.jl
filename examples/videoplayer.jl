        # # VideoPlayer.jl: Building a Video Player with Makie and VideoIO
        # This is a video player built with Makie.jl, with the intent to support VFR,
        # arbitrary resolution, out-of-memory video playing.  We used Makie so mouse
        # and keyboard inputs could be captured and used within Julia effortlessly.
        # The project was started by Yakir Gagnon (@yakir12), Ian Butterworth (@ianshmean)
        # and Anshul Singhvi (@asinghvi17).

        # # Overview of the program
        # Using VideoIO.jl, we read frames in from file, and extract an approximate timestamp.
        # Then, we rotate the image matrix, and plot it.
        # Buttons, keyboard callbacks, and a slider are set up to move through the video.

        # Imports:
        using Makie, Observables
        using VideoIO, Dates

        # In preparation for turning this into a function, we define some parameters here.
        const filename = joinpath(tempdir(), "testvideo.mp4") # can change

        # Define some helper functions.

        """

        Currently aliased to `rotr90`, but that could

        duration = VideoIO.get_duration(f.avin.io)  # Get the duration of the video.

        # Now, we read in a frame from the file, to initialize our Observable.
        img = correctimg(read(f)) |> Observable
        seekstart(f) # seek back to the beginning of the video, since we've read 1 frame.

        # We also read in the aspect ratio and resolution of the file.
        pixelaspectratio = VideoIO.aspect_ratio(f)
        h = f.height
        w = round(typeof(h), f.width * pixelaspectratio)

        # # Time system
        # We also need to set a time system up.  This consists of three Observables:
        # - `current`: seeks to the next timestamp, since FFMPEG does not have good
        #   support for seeking by frame number
        # - `correctcurrent`: provides the current time in the video, accounting for VFR,
        #   using VideoIO's `gettime` function.
        # - `timestamp`: a Observable `Time` which contains the correct, formatted time
        #    for display.
        # To update our Observables, we use two functions: `lift` provided by Makie, and
        # `on` provided by Observables.  While `on` simply executes a function when the
        # relevant Observable is updated, `lift` returns an Observable which is linked to
        # the input observable, and its value is whatever the function returns.

        current = Observable(0.0) # set up the first observable

        # Now, we set up an "event handler" function, which will seek `f` to the value of
        # `current` whenever `current` is updated.

        on(current) do t
            try
                seek(f, t)            # seek the video to the nearest frame to `t`

                if !isa(ex, EOFError) # if the at end of file, that's fine, let it stay.
                    throw(ex)
                end
            end
        end

        # Using the `lift` function, we create another Observable, which triggers on
        # `img` being triggered; this seems unrelated to `current`, but they really update
        # in the same way.

        correctcurrent = lift(_ -> gettime(f), img)

        # We also set up the timestamp, which takes a value and converts it to `DateTime`.

        # # Plotting the video
        # Now we get to the exciting bit - plotting!  Using Makie, we can plot an Observable
        # in place of data, which will cause the plot to update whenever the Observable
        # updates.  This is the core building block of the video player.
